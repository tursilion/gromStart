There are two small patches in 4A DOS, mostly meant to support the GROMStart package:

1) The name "4A DOS" is only 6 characters long, and we are searching for the 7 character "PROGRAM". Rather than make a mess of the header, I just added a second program name PROGRAM which points to the same thing.
2) When 4A DOS starts, it insists on loading CHARA1 from DSK1. With tons of memory at our disposal that felt silly, but I didn't want to make 4A DOS bigger than 8k, so instead I dropped CHARA1 in the leftover GROM space (there's still lots free) and added a small patch. The patch checks whether the GROM is present - if so, it loads CHARA1 from there instead. If not, it falls back on the normal behaviour.

Neither patch will interfere with operation if you aren't using the GROMStart package.
